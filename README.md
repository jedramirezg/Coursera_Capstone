# Vacations on New York

# Introduction: Business Problem 
In this project analyze the places that people frequent in New York at night, and know the best places to visit

The goal of this is to show people whatever the best and safest places to visit on a vacation, or even if you want to go for a walk with your family.

This does not expect to solve social problems or anything like that, the main idea is to serve as a tool that guides people in their process of going on vacation or distracting the mind in New York City

# Data 
According to the definition of our problem, the factors that will influence our decision are:

New York places visited most frequently
The schedule that people frequent most (and in this case we are interested in night time)
number of people visiting these different places
To carry out this study we take a database of visits in the city of New Your de Foursquare of the year 2013, which has user, lat, lng, time you visit, place you visit and with this to be able to order our data and show those places that we interested people can visit on vacation

# Methodology

To carry out this study we will use geophraphic information obtained from foursquare for the year 2013 of the city of New York, the first thing we are going to do is be able to identify by time slot which are the most frequented places and in what size, to be able to recommend Someone whose sites or places you can visit on a vacation. In addition, we will make a map representation of these places, showing users with real data which are those places of greatest visits thanks to the lat and lng that we can obtain from the downloaded data

# Results and Conclusion

When performing this study, it was initially intended to make a comparison between two time slots, which are at noon and at night, this in order to be able to show with real data what is the lifestyle of people who frequently live and visit New York

It was observed that in the nights places like bars, parks, gyms are the most in demand, it is a city constantly active in work because being in its offices at night is the second most frequented activated. but of course as we are talking about what to recommend to visitors, we conclude that if they want to go to a park in the evening hours they must go to places like Central Park! A traditional and beautiful place in New York! And if your plan is to go out to parties and with your friends, be in the areas near Washington Square Village, a place with a very youthful, university atmosphere, full of cultural diversity and therefore many things to enjoy and meet!
